# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)


## Instructions

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


## Solution
```
def two_sum(nums, target)
    index = []
    i = 0
    while i < nums.length
        j = i + 1
        while j < nums.length
            return index = [i, j] if nums[i] + nums[j] == target
            j += 1
        end
        i += 1
    end
    index
end
```
